dokku clickhouse:info lollipop --post-start-network
dokku clickhouse:info lollipop --service-root
dokku clickhouse:info lollipop --status
dokku clickhouse:info lollipop --version
```

### list all clickhouse services

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:list
```

List all services:

```shell
dokku clickhouse:list
```

### print the most recent log(s) for this service

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:logs <service> [-t|--tail] <tail-num-optional>
```

flags:

- `-t|--tail [<tail-num>]`: do not stop when end of the logs are reached and wait for additional output

You can tail logs for a particular service:

```shell
dokku clickhouse:logs lollipop
```

By default, logs will not be tailed, but you can do this with the --tail flag:

```shell
dokku clickhouse:logs lollipop --tail
```

The default tail setting is to show all logs, but an initial count can also be specified:

```shell
dokku clickhouse:logs lollipop --tail 5
```

### link the clickhouse service to the app

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:link <service> <app> [--link-flags...]
```

flags:

- `-a|--alias "BLUE_DATABASE"`: an alternative alias to use for linking to an app via environment variable
- `-q|--querystring "pool=5"`: ampersand delimited querystring arguments to append to the service link
- `-n|--no-restart "false"`: whether or not to restart the app on link (default: true)

A clickhouse service can be linked to a container. This will use native docker links via the docker-options plugin. Here we link it to our `playground` app.

> NOTE: this will restart your app

```shell
dokku clickhouse:link lollipop playground
```

The following environment variables will be set automatically by docker (not on the app itself, so they wonâ€™t be listed when calling dokku config):

```
DOKKU_CLICKHOUSE_LOLLIPOP_NAME=/lollipop/DATABASE
DOKKU_CLICKHOUSE_LOLLIPOP_PORT=tcp://172.17.0.1:9000
DOKKU_CLICKHOUSE_LOLLIPOP_PORT_9000_TCP=tcp://172.17.0.1:9000
DOKKU_CLICKHOUSE_LOLLIPOP_PORT_9000_TCP_PROTO=tcp
DOKKU_CLICKHOUSE_LOLLIPOP_PORT_9000_TCP_PORT=9000
DOKKU_CLICKHOUSE_LOLLIPOP_PORT_9000_TCP_ADDR=172.17.0.1
```

The following will be set on the linked application by default:

```
CLICKHOUSE_URL=clickhouse://lollipop:SOME_PASSWORD@dokku-clickhouse-lollipop:9000/lollipop
```

The host exposed here only works internally in docker containers. If you want your container to be reachable from outside, you should use the `expose` subcommand. Another service can be linked to your app:

```shell
dokku clickhouse:link other_service playground
```

It is possible to change the protocol for `CLICKHOUSE_URL` by setting the environment variable `CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE_SCHEME` on the app. Doing so will after linking will cause the plugin to think the service is not linked, and we advise you to unlink before proceeding.

```shell
dokku config:set playground CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE_SCHEME=clickhouse2
dokku clickhouse:link lollipop playground
```

This will cause `CLICKHOUSE_URL` to be set as:

```
clickhouse2://lollipop:SOME_PASSWORD@dokku-clickhouse-lollipop:9000/lollipop
```

If you specify `CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE_SCHEME` to equal `http`, we`ll also automatically adjust `CLICKHOUSE_URL` to match the http interface:

```
http://lollipop:SOME_PASSWORD@dokku-clickhouse-lollipop:${PLUGIN_DATASTORE_PORTS[1]}
```

### unlink the clickhouse service from the app

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:unlink <service> <app>
```

flags:

- `-n|--no-restart "false"`: whether or not to restart the app on unlink (default: true)

You can unlink a clickhouse service:

> NOTE: this will restart your app and unset related environment variables

```shell
dokku clickhouse:unlink lollipop playground
```

### set or clear a property for a service

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:set <service> <key> <value>
```

Set the network to attach after the service container is started:

```shell
dokku clickhouse:set lollipop post-create-network custom-network
```

Set multiple networks:

```shell
dokku clickhouse:set lollipop post-create-network custom-network,other-network
```

Unset the post-create-network value:

```shell
dokku clickhouse:set lollipop post-create-network
```

### Service Lifecycle

The lifecycle of each service can be managed through the following commands:

### connect to the service via the clickhouse connection tool

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:connect <service>
```

Connect to the service via the clickhouse connection tool:

> NOTE: disconnecting from ssh while running this command may leave zombie processes due to moby/moby#9098

```shell
dokku clickhouse:connect lollipop
```

### enter or run a command in a running clickhouse service container

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:enter <service>
```

A bash prompt can be opened against a running service. Filesystem changes will not be saved to disk.

> NOTE: disconnecting from ssh while running this command may leave zombie processes due to moby/moby#9098

```shell
dokku clickhouse:enter lollipop
```

You may also run a command directly against the service. Filesystem changes will not be saved to disk.

```shell
dokku clickhouse:enter lollipop touch /tmp/test
```

### expose a clickhouse service on custom host:port if provided (random port on the 0.0.0.0 interface if otherwise unspecified)

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:expose <service> <ports...>
```

Expose the service on the service's normal ports, allowing access to it from the public interface (`0.0.0.0`):

```shell
dokku clickhouse:expose lollipop 9000 8123
```

Expose the service on the service's normal ports, with the first on a specified ip adddress (127.0.0.1):

```shell
dokku clickhouse:expose lollipop 127.0.0.1:9000 8123
```

### unexpose a previously exposed clickhouse service

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:unexpose <service>
```

Unexpose the service, removing access to it from the public interface (`0.0.0.0`):

```shell
dokku clickhouse:unexpose lollipop
```

### promote service <service> as CLICKHOUSE_URL in <app>

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:promote <service> <app>
```

If you have a clickhouse service linked to an app and try to link another clickhouse service another link environment variable will be generated automatically:

```
DOKKU_CLICKHOUSE_BLUE_URL=clickhouse://other_service:ANOTHER_PASSWORD@dokku-clickhouse-other-service:9000/other_service
```

You can promote the new service to be the primary one:

> NOTE: this will restart your app

```shell
dokku clickhouse:promote other_service playground
```

This will replace `CLICKHOUSE_URL` with the url from other_service and generate another environment variable to hold the previous value if necessary. You could end up with the following for example:

```
CLICKHOUSE_URL=clickhouse://other_service:ANOTHER_PASSWORD@dokku-clickhouse-other-service:9000/other_service
DOKKU_CLICKHOUSE_BLUE_URL=clickhouse://other_service:ANOTHER_PASSWORD@dokku-clickhouse-other-service:9000/other_service
DOKKU_CLICKHOUSE_SILVER_URL=clickhouse://lollipop:SOME_PASSWORD@dokku-clickhouse-lollipop:9000/lollipop
```

### start a previously stopped clickhouse service

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:start <service>
```

Start the service:

```shell
dokku clickhouse:start lollipop
```

### stop a running clickhouse service

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:stop <service>
```

Stop the service and removes the running container:

```shell
dokku clickhouse:stop lollipop
```

### pause a running clickhouse service

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:pause <service>
```

Pause the running container for the service:

```shell
dokku clickhouse:pause lollipop
```

### graceful shutdown and restart of the clickhouse service container

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:restart <service>
```

Restart the service:

```shell
dokku clickhouse:restart lollipop
```

### upgrade service <service> to the specified versions

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:upgrade <service> [--upgrade-flags...]
```

flags:

- `-c|--config-options "--args --go=here"`: extra arguments to pass to the container create command (default: `None`)
- `-C|--custom-env "USER=alpha;HOST=beta"`: semi-colon delimited environment variables to start the service with
- `-i|--image IMAGE`: the image name to start the service with
- `-I|--image-version IMAGE_VERSION`: the image version to start the service with
- `-N|--initial-network INITIAL_NETWORK`: the initial network to attach the service to
- `-P|--post-create-network NETWORKS`: a comma-separated list of networks to attach the service container to after service creation
- `-R|--restart-apps "true"`: whether or not to force an app restart (default: false)
- `-S|--post-start-network NETWORKS`: a comma-separated list of networks to attach the service container to after service start
- `-s|--shm-size SHM_SIZE`: override shared memory size for clickhouse docker container

You can upgrade an existing service to a new image or image-version:

```shell
dokku clickhouse:upgrade lollipop
```

### Service Automation

Service scripting can be executed using the following commands:

### list all clickhouse service links for a given app

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:app-links <app>
```

List all clickhouse services that are linked to the `playground` app.

```shell
dokku clickhouse:app-links playground
```

### check if the clickhouse service exists

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:exists <service>
```

Here we check if the lollipop clickhouse service exists.

```shell
dokku clickhouse:exists lollipop
```

### check if the clickhouse service is linked to an app

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:linked <service> <app>
```

Here we check if the lollipop clickhouse service is linked to the `playground` app.

```shell
dokku clickhouse:linked lollipop playground
```

### list all apps linked to the clickhouse service

```shell
# usage
dokku clickhouse:links <service>
```

List all apps linked to the `lollipop` clickhouse service.

```shell
dokku clickhouse:links lollipop
```

### Disabling `docker image pull` calls

If you wish to disable the `docker image pull` calls that the plugin triggers, you may set the `CLICKHOUSE_DISABLE_PULL` environment variable to `true`. Once disabled, you will need to pull the service image you wish to deploy as shown in the `stderr` output.

Please ensure the proper images are in place when `docker image pull` is disabled.
